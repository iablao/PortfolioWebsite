# PortfolioWebsite
This is the repository for a portfolio website. It is aimed to be an all-in-one webpage where you can showcase your resume, cover letter, personal projects, etc. As well as allowing you to link all your job searching applications (i.e. LinkedIn, Handshake, Indeed, etc). This webpage is intended to be more than a Linktree and less than a LinkedIn.


In order to run the front end:

navigate to PS C:\Users\dimit\Desktop\portfoliowebsite\PortfolioWebsite\frontend\portfoliowebsite>
type "npx next dev" in the terminal
type localhost:3000/home to view the home page
use the sidebar to navigate and view the front end of the website
